### Added

- Improvements to error handling and logging when persisted session expires.
- Stability improvements.

### Changed

- `AmazonOrders.get_order_history()` now fetches each individual order using `asyncio` for 5-10x performance improvements.
- `AmazonOrders.request` now takes `persist_cookies`, which defaults to `False`. Cookies are now only persisted when the login form is submitted, rather than with every request.

- Testing environment variables are now consistently prefixed with `AMAZON_`.

### Removed

- `AmazonSession.last_response` and `AmazonSession.last_response_parsed`. These variables forced `AmazonSession` in to a statefulness that means its underlying functionality cannot be made async. Use the response object [AmazonSessionResponse](https://amazon-orders.readthedocs.io/api.html#amazonorders.util.AmazonSessionResponse) instead.
- `constants.Constants.ORDER_HISTORY_LANDING_URL`.

- Values for `username`, `password`, and `otp_secret_key` stored in `AmazonOrdersConfig` will now be used in precedence chain.
- Stability improvements to authentication flows.

### Changed

- `OTP_SECRET_KEY` is replaced with `AMAZON_OTP_SECRET_KEY`. Evaluation of `OTP_SECRET_KEY` will be removed in the next major release.

## [3.2.18](https://github.com/alexdlaird/amazon-orders/compare/3.2.17...3.2.18) - 2025-04-16

### Added

- Documentation improvements.

### Changed

- Paging is more clear now, based on [the value of `keep_paging`](https://amazon-orders.readthedocs.io/api.html#amazonorders.orders.AmazonOrders.get_order_history) (`--single-page` from the CLI) rather than evaluating `start_index`.

## [3.2.17](https://github.com/alexdlaird/amazon-orders/compare/3.2.16...3.2.17) - 2025-04-15

### Added

- Authentication will now use environment variables `AMAZON_USERNAME` and `AMAZON_PASSWORD`, if present.
